    <entry key="7bCPA.help.detail">Field no. 7 bis - Is this Country Programmable Aid (CPA)?: Country Programmable Aid
        (CPA)
        reflects the amount of aid that can be programmed by the donor at partner country level. CPA is aid which is NOT
        included in
        the following categories: (i) aid that is unpredictable by nature (humanitarian aid and debt forgiveness and
        reorganisation),
        entails no cross-border flows (development research in donor country, promotion of development awareness,
        imputed student costs,
        refugees in donor country and administrative costs), does not form part of co-operation agreements between
        governments
        (food aid and aid extended by local governments in donor countries), is not country programmable by the donor
        (core funding to national NGOs and International NGOs), or is not susceptible for programming at country level
        (e.g. contributions to Public Private Partnerships, for some donors aid extended by other agencies than the main
        aid agency).
