    <entry key="96rmnch.help">Funding interpretation of RMNCH marker scores. Expand to view full definition.</entry>
	<entry key="96rmnch.help.detail">The RMNCH marker is designed to facilitate "approximate" estimation of quantitative
amounts based on the funding interpretation shares shown in the table below where the marker
scores of "4", "3", "2", "1" and "0" correspond to 100%, 75%, 50%, 25% and 0% respectively of a
projectâ€™s funding targeted to RMNCH activities. Care should be taken not to interpret or present
these resulting data as precise and comprehensive amounts of RMNCH-related contributions.
