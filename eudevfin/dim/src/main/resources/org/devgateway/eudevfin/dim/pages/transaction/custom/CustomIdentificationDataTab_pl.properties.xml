F1	Provisional actual spending data 	Actual data for the previous year, but prior to final data validation.
F2	Future spending data for existing commitments	High certainty of planning data, changes would be due to an activity development that deviates from original planning.
F3	Future spending data for concrete measures in preparatory phase	Reduced degree of certainty; planned spending is allocated to specific projects but project design and financing commitments are prior to their finalization and approval.
F4	Indicative future spending plans (data for measures in proposal phase)	Lowest degree of certainty; planned spending is based on a "spending envelopes" for a country/region and/or sector/purpose, little detail available.
