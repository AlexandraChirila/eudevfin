	<entry key="19description.help.detail">Many agencies’ databases contain project summaries or descriptions of the main objectives of the
		activity. These can be included in the CRS++ database in a text field of unrestricted length. The information permits
		the Secretariat to check the accuracy and consistency of purpose coding. In addition, descriptive information is
		valuable in detailed sectoral studies, and allows users to make research on topics (sectors or themes) not separately
		identified in existing classifications (e.g. disability), using keyword searches.

		primary purpose is to augment the level of knowledge, skills,
		technical know-how or productive aptitudes of the
		population of developing countries, i.e. increasing their stock of
		human intellectual capital, or their capacity for
		more effective use of their existing factor endowment. This relates
		essentially to activities that either enhance or
		supply human resources. It includes financing of students and trainees
		who are nationals of developing countries;
		experts, teachers, and volunteers; equipment and materials for training;
		research; development-oriented social and
		cultural programmes, etc. Associated supplies are also classified as
		technical co-operation.
